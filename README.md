# Spring is NEAR 2022 Challenge 8: Roketo Challenge

## Problem Statement
Roketo, a crypto streaming service, announces a new challenge to reveal the product’s strongest side – their real-time payments.  
The task is to create a service application of Roketo for any pay per minute service such as co-working, car parking, equipment rental, etc. The MVP of a service could work partially, but the payment in that service should be done through Roketo and work. Use Roketo streaming smart contract as a payment method in your MVP.  

To take part in challenge, follow these steps:  
- Choose a particular situation applicable for real-time payments.
- (ok this statement is confusing but I guess we don't need to do this?) Then find a way to onboard people into the topic (Roketo & NEAR).
- Come up with a tool / product /service / dApp where Roketo payment solution will be integrated. Do not hesitate to create a simple UI to use our contract. So the goal is to find a way to lay our technology on daily tasks.
- Make a video presentation with an idea explanation.
